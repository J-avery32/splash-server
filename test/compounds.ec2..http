    "documentation": "Properties\r\nPresence in aqueous solutions (Wolska and Bryjak 2013, reference 320)\r\nBoron has various oxidation states in compounds but the most significant and common is +3. It appears in lower oxidation states +1, 0 or less than 0, but these states are found in compounds such as e.g. higher borates only [1,2].\r\nHigh solubility (55 g\/L at 25C)\r\n\r\nHuman toxicity (Wolska and Bryjak 2013, ref 320)\r\nThis element has a positive effect on the metabolism of several other nutrients such as calcium, copper or nitrogen [22]. It was noted that boron deficiency reduced absorption of calcium, magnesium and phosphorus [5]\r\nBoron has a positive effect on functioning of many organs but long-term consumption of water and food with increased boron content results in creation of problems with cardiovascular, coronary, nervous and reproductive systems [23,24]. \r\nMoreover, it causes changes in blood composition, neurological effects, physical disorders and intellec- tual development of children. Excess of boron can be particularly dangerous for pregnant women as it increases the risk of birth patholo- gy. High daily doses of boron cause testicular atrophy and degeneration [23,24]. Doses greater than 500 mg\/day may cause nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, anorexia or weigh loss [23,24]\r\n\r\nRelevance to Produced Water \/ M-WET\r\nPresence in geologic formations \r\nHilal et al. 2011 (ref 196): Boron is widely distributed in both the hydrosphere and lithosphere of the earth [1]. In nature, boron is never found elemental but always as various forms of complex compounds combining with oxygen and other elements. In the lithosphere, it is found in rocks and soils. \r\n\r\nTreatment Options and Challenges\r\nMembrane Treatment \r\nHilal et al. 2011 (ref 196): This effectiveness is not mirrored by reverse osmosis desalination technology where boron removal is shown to be insufficient. This is because a large proportion of boron in seawater generally exists as uncharged boric acid which can diffuse through the RO membrane in the way similar to water. This in turn decreases the percentage rejection of boron from sea- water [32,33]. \r\nWolska and Bryjak 2013 (ref 320): In order to remove residual boric acid, in majority of membrane processes pH has to be raised to the value of 10\u201311 [52]. In such conditions, boric acid transforms to borates (see Fig. 1) that are further processed. Although increasing the alkalinity of the solution enables the removal of borates with the efficiency of 98\u201399%, the high pH value favors the precipitation of the magnesium and calcium hydroxides on the membrane surface [53,54], a phenomenon known as \u201Cscaling\u201D. \r\n\r\nAdsorption (Wolska and Bryjak 2013, ref 320)\r\nUse of chelating resins\r\nchelating resins containing ligands having three or more hydroxyl groups, located in the cis position, the so-called \u201CVis-diols\u201D, show a high selectivity to boron while these groups are not reactive to ordinary metals and other elements \r\nMolecules of polyoxide compounds tend to bond through the formation of boric acid esters of boron or borate anion complexes with a proton as a counterion [4,9,19,29]. The obtained results suggest that the presence of tertiary amine group is critical for boron chelating. It captures proton freed during complexing of borate by hydroxyl functionalities [29\u201331]. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStandard Operating Procedures\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPurchase Options (including purity)\r\n\r\n"}
